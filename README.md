I have made and tested this EFI on Dell Latitude E5570, but I need a confirmation if this EFI is working on other Dell Skylake E-Series Models.

# EFI Compatibily List:

| Model | CPU Name | Is that supported ? | Note |

1: Disable your dGPU (If you have) with a [SSDT](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/Laptops/laptop-disable.html)

**Note: This list is not completed. If you have compatible model and it worked with my EFI, please make a confirmation.**

- Two picture below are listing what SSDTs and patches I have used.

# How do I install macOS?

- You should change your BIOS: [BIOS Setting Guide](https://github.com/quynkk1/e-series-skylake-hackintosh-dell/blob/main/Tutorials/BIOS.md)

**You have 2 options:**

Option 1: [Online install.](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/) It may take a long time to install. Use this method when you have USB lower than 8GB or you just chill in your free time, lmao üê∏.

Option 2: [Offline install.]() This method requires you have USB larger than 8GB (Recommend 16GB at least).

- All you need is download this EFI from Release tab and copy it into your EFI Partition in your USB.
